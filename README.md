### ***Description***

##### The goal of the lab is to put in repitition doing everything that we did during the *Express - Routers & Controllers*, *Express - Middleware*, and *Mongoose - Referencing Related Data* lessons.
***

### ***Technologies Used***

* ##### JavaScript
* ##### HTML
* ##### CSS
* ##### Node.js/Express
* ##### MongoDB/Mongoose
***

### ***Getting Started***

##### Use this website to keep track of flights. New flights can be added to the list, destinations can be added to each flight, and seats can be booked for each flight. Use the nav bar on top to move easily throughout the views.
##### The project can normally be viewed [here](https://mlackey9601.github.io/mongoose-flights/), however we have not yet learned how to upload our projects to Heroku.
